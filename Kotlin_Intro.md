## Kotlin Basics: Variables, Data Types, and Operators
Now that your development environment is set up, let's delve into the building blocks of Kotlin: variables, data types, and operators.

In Kotlin, declaring a variable is a breeze. The `val` keyword is used for read-only variables, and `var` for mutable ones. 

### Example 3: Declaring Variables 
```kotlin 
val pi = 3.14 
var counter = 0
```

In this example, `pi` is a read-only variable initialized with the value 3.14, while `counter` is a mutable variable starting at 0.

### Data Types in Kotlin 
Kotlin supports a rich set of data types, including integers, floats, booleans, and strings. 
The compiler automatically infers the type, but you can also explicitly specify it.

### Example 4: Exploring Data Types 
```kotlin 
val age: Int = 25 
val height: Double = 175.5
val isStudent: Boolean = true 
val name: String = "Alice" 
``` 

Here, we've defined variables with specific data types: `age` as an integer, `height` as a double, `isStudent` as a boolean, and `name` as a string.
