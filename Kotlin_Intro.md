## Kotlin Basics: Variables, Data Types, and Operators
Now that your development environment is set up, let's delve into the building blocks of Kotlin: variables, data types, and operators.

In Kotlin, declaring a variable is a breeze. The `val` keyword is used for read-only variables, and `var` for mutable ones. 

### Example 3: Declaring Variables 
```kotlin val pi = 3.14 
var counter = 0 ``` 
In this example, `pi` is a read-only variable initialized with the value 3.14, while `counter` is a mutable variable starting at 0.
